# Server Faker JS (get fake data)

## Motivation

I was wanting to experiment Faker.js library and its functionalities and in the future maybe host this simple backend on a server just for study purposes.

## How to run

- npm install
- node server.js

## Usage

Open in your web browser after start the server:
eg.: http://localhost:8000/get?type=person&qtd=9

It should return 9 fake people

or http://localhost:8000/get?type=animals&qtd=4

It should return 4 fake animals
